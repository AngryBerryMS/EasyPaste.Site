In this article, we will introduce you how to use EasyPaste.

**Collect Clipboard History**

When you copy text, image, or file, EasyPaste will automatically collect the clipboard history. You can view the clipboard history by clicking the EasyPaste icon in the menu bar. Or you can use the shortcut key `Control + V` to open the clipboard history.

> `Control + V` is the default shortcut key. You can change it in the settings.



**Paste Clipboard Item**

When you want to paste a clipboard item:

-  Open the main window by shortcut key `Control + V` or clicking the EasyPaste icon in the menu bar.
-  Select the clipboard item you want to paste.
-  Now the item will be pasted to the frontmost app. If the item isn't pasted to the frontmost app, the item is actually copied to the clipboard. You can paste it by pressing `Command + V`.

**Pin Clipboard Item**

You can pin your favorite clipboard items to help you quickly find clipboard items that you use frequently.

**Delete Clipboard Item**

You can delete a clipboard item by clicking the delete button in the clipboard item.
